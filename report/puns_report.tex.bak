\title{Pun Classification and Location}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\begin{abstract}
	Pun identification and location are challenging natural language processing 
	tasks. We implemented several algorithms for both, with results which 
	were comparable to those outlined in the SemEval conference which originally
	defined the tasks.

\subsection{Baseline}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsection{Feature Comparison}
We introduced various features to improve accuracy Table \ref{tab:List_of_features}. Indexes in this table represent the index of each feature in the code and figures we made for feature analysis. Features were added to the code one by one to find whether they improve accuracy. In general, we saw accuracy improved with adding features. Accuracy change behave differently against each feature.\\
Next step was to find what feature combination led to the largest accuracy. We designed a code to find various combinations of features. The code generated list of indexes of all possible number of feature a code can have. Length of the list was between one to number of feature, 1 to 16. With 16 feature we could have 65535 possible combination. The pun detection code took about 60s to be done. If we wanted to test all these combination it took about 1092 hours. In this regards, we did trail and error run to see what feature improve accuracy. Finally, we used 11 features that indexed from 0 to 10 in the table \ref{tab:List_of_features} for feature comparison. \\
With using 11 feature we were able to create 2047 features combination. Then we calculated accuracy for detection of homographic and heterographic puns. This let to 4089 runs. We found 100 percent accuracy anytime unigaram appears in any combination which is sign on over fitting. So we eliminated this feature form analysis. \\
Figures \ref{fig:ACC_Train_Homo} and \ref{fig:ACC_Train_Hetero} shows the 10 largest accuracy of feature combination for training set of homographic and heterographic pun. These figure shows accuracy of training pun more than 96 percent for both pun.

Figures \ref{fig:ACC_Test_Homo} and \ref{fig:ACC_Test_Hetero} shows the 10 largest accuracy of testing set for homographic and heterographic.\\
