\section{Overview}
A pun is a form of wordplay within the class of textual phenomena involving
ambiguity where multiple meanings of a word or set of words are played upon to
create a rhetorical effect. They occur in many domains: in advertising, puns
are used to connect a product with a desirable quality; in literature, puns are
used to add a level of meaning and implicaiton; in conversation, puns add humor
to the topic at hand.

Understanding a pun often requires the integration of information from a large
number of contexts; syntax, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics, and context
can all come into play. There are many types of puns:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Homographic}: A pun involving two words whose spellings are
		the same but have different meanings.
		\begin{center}
		\emph{I used to be a banker but I lost \textbf{interest}.}
		\end{center}
	}
	\item{\textbf{Heterographic}: A pun involving two or more words which sound
		alike but are spelled differently. Sometimes termed `homophonic'.
		\begin{center}
		\emph{Two construction workers had a \textbf{stairing} contest.}
		\end{center}
	}
	\item{\textbf{Compound}: A sentence containing two or more puns.
		\begin{center}
		\emph{Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert? Because he can
		eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there?
		Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred.} - Richard Whately
		\end{center}
	}
	\item{\textbf{Visual}: A pun realized by an image. See figure \ref{fig:visual_pun}\footnote{\url{https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/punny-pixels-illustrated-puns-visual-wordplay/}}.
	}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\caption{A visual Pun.}\label{fig:visual_pun}
\end{figure}

We focused on two types: homographic puns and heterographic puns. 

\subsection{Motivation}

It would be desirable for machines to be able to identify, comprend, and
generate puns for a number of reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A pun generator could facilitate slogan generation, which would be
		useful in advertising and dialogue agents.
	\item A pun identifier could be used to improve machine translations, where
		literal translation of puns rarely conveys the original text's message.
	\item A pun comprehension system would be helpful for large-scale textual
		analyses of the kind increasingly being employed in the digital
		humanities.
\end{itemize}

We worked on two related tasks: pun detection and pun location.

\subsection{Dataset}

We trained and tested our algorithms on the test sets used to appraise the
competing systems in SemEval2017 Task 7. The dataset for each of the tasks we
worked on was split into two parts: homographic and heterographic. We modified
the characteristics of these datasets to address some issues we found. Namely,
the original datasets for the detection tasks for both heterographic and
homographic puns had a pun/non-pun split of 70/30. The non-pun sentences for
each type of pun were, however, non-overlapping, so we simply modified each pun
type's dataset to include \emph{all} non-puns from either dataset, giving us a
more even ratio of pun/non-pun.\

% Pun Detection

\section{Pun Detection}\label{pun_detection}

Pun detection is a binary classification problem: given a sequence of words (a
sentence), determine whether or not that sentence contains a pun. 

We tried a number of different approaches to this problem, but found that the
best approach was a Bidirectional LSTM.

\subsection{Baseline: Multinomial Naive Bayes}

A random approach to this task will have a 50\% of being correct. However, we
wanted to determine whether we could do better than random with a simple
classifier. To that end, we implemented a simple Multinomial Naive Bayes
classifier. 

\subsection{Linear SVM}

We implemented a linear SVM and trained it using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
The intution behind this was that an SVM would be able to incorporate arbitrary
features, and that the data would be linearly separable with the right features.
This approach worked quite well, but was slightly less effective than our neural
net approach.

\subsubsection{Feature Comparison}

We tried to improve the Linear SVM's performance by including a variety of
features (Table \ref{tab:List_of_features}), as well as using different
combinations of those features.  Features were added to the code one by one to
find whether they improve accuracy. In general, accuracy improved with the
addition of more features.

We determined which combinations of features would improve the algorithm the
most using a heuristic based approach to select the features to include in
combinations. Testing all combinations of features was not feasible: with 16
features and 65535 combinations of those features, testing each one at a runtime
of 60 seconds per run would have taken 1092 hours. After identifying 11
features (0-10 in table \ref{tab:List_of_features}), we ran a brute-force search
of the 2047 combinations (over both the heterographic and homographic datasets)
of those features to determine which was best.

Figures \ref{fig:ACC_Test_Homo} and \ref{fig:ACC_Test_Hetero} show the 10 best
combinations of features found for the homographic and heterographic datasets,
respectively.

\begin{table}
\caption{Features by Index}\label{tab:List_of_features} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} 
\toprule
\textbf{\#} &\textbf{Feature Name}		& \textbf{\#} &	\textbf{Feature Name}\\
\midrule
0	&	Lesk Algorithm					& 8		&	Idiom is in Pun or Not\\
1	&	Pos								& 9		&	Antonyms is in Pun or Not\\
2	&	tfidf							& 10	&	Homonym is in Pun or Not\\
3	&	Embeddings						& 11	&	Bigram\\
4	&	Unigram							& 12	&	Trigram\\
5	&	Number of Homophone in Pun		& 13	&	Positives\\
6	&	Number of Each Homophone in Pun & 14	&	Negatives\\
7	&	Homophone is in Pun or Not		& 15	&	All or First Caps\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/Accuracy_on_Test_Set_for_Heterographic_Pun.png}
  \caption{Heterographic Pun Feature Comparison Accuracy}\label{fig:ACC_Test_Hetero}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bidirectional LSTM}

Despite having a fairly small dataset, we decided to try a neural net on the
problem. We chose an LSTM because of its ability to deal with variable-sentence
lengths, as (somewhat obviously) our dataset featured sentences of different
lengths. This was our most effective approach. We used glove embeddings with a
length of 300.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Pun Location
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Pun Location}\label{pun_location}

Pun location is a less straightforward task than pun detection: given a set of
words known to contain a pun, identify the pun word. Though this problem is less
amenable to traditional machine learning algorithms, it can be rephrased to be
more similar to one: for each word in the sentence, determine the likelihood
that that word is a pun given the rest of the sentence. Then, output the word
which is most likely to be a pun based on the output of the previous search.

\subsection{Baseline 1: Multinomial Naive Bayes}

A random approach to this dataset does not work particularly well; it will have
an accuracy of about 1 divided by the average length of the sentence. We again
used our multinomial naive bayes algorithm as a baseline. It did not work very
well.

\subsection{Baseline 2: Heuristic-Based Decision Tree}

This algorithm contains no machine learning, and simply uses heuristics based on
the presence of homophones, homonyms, antonyms, and idioms. It performes quite
well, particularly on the heterographic dataset.

\subsection{Bidirectional LSTM}

We implemented a Bidirection LSTM but treated the problem as a sequence labeling
task. We then took the maximum prediction of that sequence and used that as the
index of the most likely word. This approach was competitive for the homographic
dataset but did not work very well for the heterographic one.

\subsection{Sliding Window Based Maximum-Entropy Markov Model}

We implemented a MEMM which took a word and a window of words preceding and
following it, as well as a number of features based on that word formed using
feature templates, which output the probability that that word was a pun or not.
Our intuition behind this approach was twofold: 1) it could handle arbitrary
features; 2) it could handle arbitrary sentence lengths.

\subsection{What Went Well}

We did particularly well at pun detection, largely leveraging the size of our
dataset over what the systems at SemEval had access to. We also were fairly
successful in trying different algorithms. 

\subsection{What We Could Have Done Better}

The best systems at SemEval applied different approaches to the problem for the
two types of data, heterographic and homographic. This makes sense, as the
characteristics of those two datasets differ significantly. Generally, our
approach would have benefitted from adding more information to our attempts at
the heterographic dataset, perhaps converting the words in a sentence into their
phonemes and identifing possible words which were close in sound.

\subsection{Future Work}

An obvious shortcoming of our system is that it will only predict \emph{one
word} as the pun word, but, and the idea that there is \emph{one word} the makes
a pun is somewhat dubious (not to mention that compound puns exist). Consider
the following pun: 
\begin{center}
	\emph{The rabbi got hit on the temple.}
\end{center}
Our system would say that the punword is ``temple'', but that is really only half
the story; if the word ``rabbi'' were replaced with, say, ``monk'', there would
be no pun. The ability to identify the words \emph{involved} in a pun would be
much more useful, and to the authors of this report, more interesting.

Of obvious interest is the ability to detect further types of puns, perhaps
using context provided by differt types of data; it would be extremely
interesting to create a system which could identify visual puns. 

It would be of interest to say \emph{what} about the words in a sentence make it
a pun. In other words, the creation of a system which could interpret puns.

A more out-there hope would be a system which could generate puns, perhaps being
given a sentence and a pair of word senses.
