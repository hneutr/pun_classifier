\title{Pun Classification and Location}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\begin{abstract}
	Pun identification and location are challenging natural language processing 
	tasks. We implemented several algorithms for both, with results which 
	were comparable to those outlined in the SemEval conference which originally
	defined the tasks.

\section{Overview}

\subsection{Pun Structure}

here we will talk about what puns are
\begin{itemize}

\item homographic
\item heterographic
\item other types

\end{itemize}

here we will talk about the problems we worked on.
